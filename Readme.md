## Switching density network pendulum controller identification



As an explanation aid, we include a jupyter notebook that provides a mimimum working example of a switching density network.
More details can be found in the CoRL 2019 paper [Hybrid system identification using switching density networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04360).
